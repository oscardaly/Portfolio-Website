      <h1>Culture as a Service</h1>
      <p>
        On Thursday 26th I was invited to speak on the panel of the first-ever
        NI Chamber of Commerce: Future Workforce Summit in Titanic Belfast.
        There were some really interesting talks and speeches throughout the
        morning that I listened to and have put my notes below to see what we
        might be able to extract some value from here at Instil, these notes are
        not my own thoughts/opinions but just interesting notes from speeches:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Changing the culture by using benefits at the top - “Leading by
          example by leaving loudly“ - we need leadership to openly use the
          benefits and flexibility that a company offers because this shows
          employees that they don’t need to feel bad for taking advantage of the
          flexible working/benefits when managers do too which in turn promotes
          a safer environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remote first isn’t just for parents - there was a lot of discussion
          about how being remote-first doesn't just mean that people with
          families and kids are more likely to be happy, but it also means that
          we’re able to hire from a much larger more diverse group of people for
          example, as the company will be more accessible for people with a
          disability or who are elderly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Alchemy grew to 160 people in 5 years and put it down to their
          mentoring and flat structure - they found that by giving their
          employees a mentor who was only ~1 year ahead of where they are they
          were able to keep staff and allow them to grow at a fast pace.
        </li>
        <li>
          Too much competition - we need to structure an organisation so
          employees aren’t competing against each other for the next promotion
          or big win but instead, they collaborate. This is a culture and
          company structure thing, we want teams to be supportive of each other
          and collaborative as this is where the most growth will come from
          instead of waiting for each other to fail.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can’t grow if we don’t know what’s wrong - We’re too nice about
          giving feedback in 1 to 1s, this is because mentors aren’t trained
          enough on how to give negative feedback. We need to provide more
          training for mentors to give negative feedback and for employees to
          take negative feedback and learn/grow from that. Once we have this we
          can provide more constructive criticism and mentorship to help
          employees grow quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Higher retention from being open about salary - This company found
          that posting salaries online so everyone knows they’re getting the
          same and are open about what the next promotion will bring them led to
          a massive increase in retention of employees.
        </li>
        <li>
          People don’t leave jobs for more money - Research has shown that most
          people don’t leave jobs for a pay increase, instead, they leave
          because they don’t feel like the work that they’re doing has purpose -
          how can we make people feel like their project is important and that
          they have purpose in their team?
        </li>
        <li>
          Mentoring training for any leaders - a common theme throughout the day
          was of people celebrating their success in mentorship programmes for
          their leaders - “mentoring programme has totally transformed our
          retention rate”, it allows us to retain talent and grow that talent.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can’t just train on technical skills - It’s so clear that no
          organisation can work with employees who are all incredibly talented
          technically but have no soft skills and this is something that
          employers generally forget about. Companies can be too focused on
          performance gains due to technical training that they forget that soft
          skills are a massive part of how successful teams are, training needs
          to be provided for soft skills not just technical skills.
